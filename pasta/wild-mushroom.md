## Ingredients
- wild mushroom mix 
- thyme (1-2 sprigs)

- shallot (around 1 small clove)
- garlic (1 clove)
- parmigiano reggiano (1 cupish grated) 
- fresh mushrooms (optional)
- truffle oil (optional)
- cream (optional)

## Equipment
- pot (make sure if you use wider pastas it fits in pot)
- large pan (to be able to toss and stir pasta)
- chopsticks or spatula (i perfer chopsticks)


## Instructions
1. chop wild mushrooms fine dice, leave some kinda chunky 
   - if using dried suggest using a food processor or spice grinder
   - rehydrate in water 10-20ish mins? 
2. start boiling pot of water for pasta, add salt until very salty but not super unbearable 
   - add pasta when water starts boiling
3. fine dice or grate garlic and shallot, grate parm reggiano  
4. once water is starting to simmer start sauteeing wild mushrooms in butter say 3-4 mins on med high heat
5. add oil if needed, garlic, shallot, and thyme turn down heat to medium, continue sauteeing for a few mins, add small pinch of salt and super small pinch of pepper if you'd like 
   - can strip off easily by pinching and sliding down stem top to bottom
   - if extra soaking liquid from mushrooms i usually add it around here little by little just letting it get soaked up by mushrooms
6. pasta should be ready around now, try some see if it needs more time. turn off heat for pan and transfer pasta over to the pan with a little pasta water
7. add egg yolk, add cheese in thirds and toss and/or stir vigorously, adding more cheese to thicken sauce or more pasta water to loosen to consinstency you like
   - i tend not to use cream or milk but i think this is where you'd add it if u did
8. add light drizzle of truffle oil if u wanna be bougie like that and toss one more time
9. taste it 
10. plate and top with more cheese (just remember to say when)
